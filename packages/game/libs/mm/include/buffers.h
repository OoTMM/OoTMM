#ifndef FRAMEBUFFERS_START_ADDR
/**
 * The `framebuffers` segment is located at a fixed location in RAM and has a
 * fixed size.
 * Those framebuffers are placed at the end of the RAM space.
 * This address is calculated by doing `0x80800000 - (size of framebuffers)`,
 * where 0x80800000 is the end of the Expansion Pak address range.
 * In the vanilla game this value expands to `0x80780000`.
 *
 * Since the start of the `framebuffers` segment is the end of the not-fixed
 * available RAM, then the `system_heap` covers all the remaining RAM that is
 * not used by the non-relocatable code/data (i.e. `boot`, `code`, and other
 * buffers) up to the start of the `framebuffers` segmemt.
 * @see `Main`
