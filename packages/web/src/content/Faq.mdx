## <a name="what_is_this"></a>What is this?
This is OoTMM, a cross randomizer between Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask.  
You can find the items in either game, and the default goal is to beat Ganon and Majora.

## <a name="switch_games"></a>How do I switch between games?
The Mask Shop in Ocarina of Time leads to the Clock Tower in South Clock Town in Majora's Mask.  
However, if you have the setting **Cross-Game Warps** enabled,
you will be able to use Ocarina of Time Warp songs in Majora's Mask to warp to Ocarina of Time and Song of Soaring to be able to soar to Majora's Mask from Ocarina of Time.

## <a name="swap_trade_items"></a>I got a trade item but it is only showing my previous one, what happened?
Press L or C-Up to swap between trade items while hovering over the trade slot.  
In addition, you will see trade items overlap each other if you have more than one trade item.  
Pressing L/C-Up will advance to the next one in sequence.

## <a name="mm_ocarina_song"></a>Can the MM Ocarina / MM Song of Time be found in Majora's Mask?
Generally no, the logic expects you to have the Ocarina and Song of Time before doing any check in Majora's Mask (there are some exceptions to this such as the Clock Tower platform, Song of Healing check and the South Clock Town Owl Statue if shuffled).  
In other words, the MM Ocarina and MM Song of Time will always be placed in Ocarina of Time.  
However, if you turn on the setting New Cycle Moon then MM Ocarina of Time and MM Song of Time can be placed anywhere inside Majora's Mask as well.  
The reason for this is because New Cycle Moon effectively behaves like Song of Time where when the moon crashes,   
it resets back to Day 1 with no progress lost; you keep all your items and progression in your seed.

## <a name="master_sword"></a>The Master Sword pedestal is empty and I can't become adult!
In the default settings of the randomizer, the Master Sword is shuffled and required to become an adult.  
The swords are progressive, so you will also need to find a Kokiri Sword first.  
Note that the Master Sword pedestal is itself a check, as a result of Master Sword being shuffled.  
However, you can change these settings by selecting any of the other existing Presets or by turning off Master Sword shuffle which will put the Master Sword in the Temple of Time.  
You can also change the settings to just start with the Master Sword or even keep it shuffled but then allow adult to be swordless. The options are endless!

## <a name="free_reward"></a>I did not start with a free Spiritual Stone / Medallion!
This is normal. The Light Medallion check, given to you for free in OoTR, is now obtained when going adult for the first time.  
Note that it can also be a Boss Remains from Majora's Mask.

## <a name="owl_statues"></a>How do owl statues work?
The save system in Majora's Mask have been changed to be mostly similar to Ocarina of Time.  
As a result, there are no temporary saves anymore. You can save at owl statues, and the save will be permanent.  
It will also not kick you out of the game like it does in vanilla.  
Note that you don't need the owl statue to be activated in order to save.  
If you need to activate an owl statue for soaring but lack a sword, you can use a deku stick instead.

## <a name="ikana_canyon"></a>Logic expects me to go to Ikana Canyon but I don't have the Garo Mask!
The Gibdo Mask also works, this is vanilla behavior.

## <a name="saving"></a>How does saving works?
In Ocarina of Time, you can save at any time, like in the base game.  
In Majora's Mask, you can save at owl statues. See the question about owl statues above.  
In addition to that, the game autosaves every time you travel between Majora's Mask and Ocarina of Time.  
Additionally, you can also save anywhere via the Quest Status Screen in Majora's Mask with L or C-Up, a save chime will play to indicate the game saved.  
This is used to essentially save warp in Majora's Mask and allow you to get out of softlockable-situations (such as Great Bay Temple without Hookshot to get out).  
When you save in Majora's Mask and then reset, you will be back in Ocarina of Time.

## <a name="moon_crash"></a>Help, I saved right before the Moon crashes!
Don't worry. When traveling to MM, the game will always give you a grace period of at least 10 seconds before the moon crashes, going slightly back in time if necessary.  
That should be more than enough to equip the Ocarina and play the Song of Time.  
And as mentioned earlier, if you're playing with New Cycle Moon then a moon crash is not fatal and will rewind back to Day 1 with no progress lost.

## <a name="trade_items_get_back"></a>How do I get the Majora's Mask trade items back?
Just play the song of time. All trade items that you previously obtained will be given back to you.

## <a name="gold_dust"></a>How do I get the Gold Dust back?
In OoTMM, the gold dust is a permanent item that you need to use at some point, similar to Ruto's Letter.  
You will keep it through song of time and also can't sell it to free the bottle.

## <a name="red_blue_potion"></a>How do I get a Red Potion or Blue Potion in Majora's Mask with Shops and Scrubs shuffled?
When you have Shops and Scrubs shuffled, the red and blue potion refills will be in the item pool.  
This means they will not be in their traditional location.  
As a result of this, in order to make sure the player has access to at least one of these for the locations or checks that require them, we came up with a system called Renewable Locations.  
What are Renewable Locations? They are any location or check that allows the player to repeatedly buy or receive an item.  
Potions, beans, milk, and so on are valid to be placed and land on these locations.

These locations include the following (when shuffled):
 - Shops
 - Scrubs
 - Tingle
 - Extra Merchants (currently Gorman Bros. Milk and Milk Bar Purchases)
 - Cows
 - Generic Fairy Fountains (the ones containing the fairies that fly around)
 - Fishing Pond Fish
 - Zora Diving Game Rupees

Any of these locations can have a renewable red or blue potion, milk, MM Magic Beans, Chateau Romani or otherwise.  
It is important to note down where you saw one of these in case you need it later as any refills found in chests, freestanding items, or from NPCs are not able to be gotten again.

## <a name="emulators"></a>What emulators are supported?
The recommended emulators are PJ64 (3.0 or later), PJ64-EM and Retroarch with Mupen64Plus-Next core.  
As of recent developments, you can also use Ares to play OoTMM.  
Do note that Ares prides itself on being as accurate as possible to the N64 and thus requires a decent computer to use it.  

Other emulators that have been less tested and are generally unsupported (meaning if they run into issues or settings not working, OoTMM is not responsible):
 - BizHawk has extremely long load times and because of this, warping between games looks like it will crash.  
<pre>     There may be other issues. You will lose a considerable amount of time playing on Bizhawk.</pre>
 - Simple64 works extremely poorly
 - Old versions of Mupen have issues similar to BizHawk
 - ModLoader is said to work with mods disabled and in offline mode (but still not recommended at all)

## <a name="everdrive"></a>Is Everdrive supported?
As of recent developments, Everdrive 3.0, X5, and X7 all are completely 100% compatible and playable with OoTMM.  
There are currently no issues with these versions of Everdrive as long as your firmware is up to date (3.06 for 3.0, 3.07+ for X5 and X7).  
Everdrive 2.5 or similar devices that run on that same firmware will crash upon going to Majora's Mask and are unsupported, however.  
If you run into any issues while playing on Everdrive 3.0, X5, or X7 join the Discord and go to the #tech-support channel to receive help.

## <a name="hint_distribution"></a>Hint Distribution

## <a name="versions"></a>What versions work for this rando?

Ocarina of Time: **1.0 NTSC-U (US)** or **NTSC-J (JP)**

Majora's Mask: **US Only**

If you try to use any other version of these games you will receive an error on the web generator.  
Please keep in mind that .zip and .rar files must be extracted before use.

## <a name="locked_doors"></a>Are any locked doors altered compared to vanilla?

One Key from Fire Temple and from Water Temple was removed from the dungeons and one door each was unlocked with this.  
This is done for logic purposes.

Fire Temple: In Fire you can have Megaton Hammer, in which case you can reach only one chest but there are two locked doors.

Water Temple: This is to ensure that you can always raise the water to the top.

## <a name="retroarch_crash"></a>My game is crashing under Retroarch

Make sure that the following is correct:
 - You are using the core **mupen64-next, version 2.4 or higher**
 - You have the "Framerate" option set to **Original**

## <a name="ingame_tracker"></a>How can I keep track of shuffled dungeon items?

There is an in-game menu to help keeping track of that.  
You can press L or C-Up on the Map/Dungeon menu to open it.  
The dungeon items menu keeps track of the following:

 - Maps
 - Compasses
 - Boss Keys
 - Small Keys
 - Stray Fairies
 - Skulltula Tokens (Gold, Swamp and Ocean)
 - Silver Rupees
 - Clocks
 - Triforce Pieces
 - Coins
 - Souls Collected (if you press L/C-Up to go to the next pages)  

## <a name="door_of_time"></a>Some of the Spiritual Stones seems to be locked behind Adult

You do not need the 3 spiritual stones to open the door of time. What you need depends on the settings you chose:

 - Open Door of Time: You don't need anything.
 - Closed Door of Time: You need an Ocarina (Fairy or Time) and the Song of Time.

In addition, note that you need the Master Sword to become adult depending on your settings.

## <a name="diff_alr_bo"></a>What is the difference between "All Locations" and "Beatable Only"?

In All Locations, logic will ensure that you can reach all locations in the games.  
In **Beatable Only**, logic will only ensure you can beat the games, but some locations may be permanently unreachable.  
The latter can lead to a lot of confusion over whether or not you are softlocked sometimes (when you aren't, you just do not need to go to the place that you are locked out of) so it is recommended to stick to **All Locations** logic if you are new to randomizers.
